Planning a day trip to Paris? Only the best of the best will do. Here’s where to stay, eat, and explore over 24 perfect hours in Paris.

## Where to Stay

**Le Bristol Paris:** Le Bristol Paris is the epitome of French elegance, and with 190 curated rooms, it will surely delight even the most discerning traveler. There are also secrets hiding in almost every corner — including one of the best views in Paris. When booking, ask for a room facing the Eiffel Tower, so you can open your balcony each morning to that unforgettable sight. Looking for a meal after check in? Guests don’t need to travel far to enjoy some of the best food in the city thanks to not one but two Michelin-starred restaurants on site — the three-star Epicure and the one-star brasserie 114 Faubourg.

## What to Eat

**Breakfast at Coutume:** With several locations across Paris, Coutume isn’t hard to find, but we love its flagship location on Rue de Babylone. Here, guests can order any coffee they wish from its well-curated menu of specialty beans, along with fluffy pancakes, eggs, and tartines piled high with delicious toppings off its brunch menu.

**Lunch at Les Enfants du Marché:** If you’re looking for a low-key way to have lunch without sacrificing any of the world-class flavors you can find in Paris, head to Les Enfants du Marché. Tucked away in the corner of one of Paris’s oldest covered markets, the unassuming restaurant serves a seafood-forward menu, including mussels in a gorgonzola emulsion and Galician sea urchins.

**Dinner at Avant Comptoir de la Terre:** Snag a quick and delicious bite at the hideaway spot Avant Comptoir de la Terre. Offering small plates and tasty wines, the destination is a favorite for travelers and locals alike.

## What to Do

**Rent a bike:** E-bikes are sprinkled all across Paris. Most companies offer them for about .25 cents per minute, so you can cruise from one end to the next. We suggest making your way down the Seine, for a leisurely and scenic ride.

**Atelier de Lumiere:** Immerse yourself in art like never before with a visit to Atelier de Lumiere, produced by Culturespaces. The exhibit allows visitors to literally walk into the works of Marc Chagall. The Chagall exhibit is slated to run until January 2024.

**Picnic with a view:** Stop in at a boulangerie for a baguette, which sell for about 1 euro. The iconic food was just named to Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Then, make your way to the Eiffel Tower. But, rather than go all the way to the top, go to the lawn, where you can sit and enjoy the view for as long as you’d like for free.
